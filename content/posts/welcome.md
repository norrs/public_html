This starter post demonstrates how Markdown becomes clean HTML. The header above shows when the file was created and the latest Git commit that touched it.

## Live preview workflow

1. Run `npm run dev` (or `hugo server -D`) to start a local web server.
2. Edit any Markdown file under `content/`.
3. The browser refreshes automatically each time you save.

## Deploying

Push changes to the default branch and the GitHub Actions workflow will publish the generated HTML to the `gh-pages` branch, making it easy to serve the site via GitHub Pages.

## Editing files

Adding content while the webserver is up and saving the file, regenerates the file.. :-)
